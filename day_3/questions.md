## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  * Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code depending on whether a boolean condition evaluates true or false according to operators `(<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, &&, ||)`.
  * Example 1: `if a == 1 then do something`
  * Example 2: `if b != 1 then do something`
  * Example 3: `if c && d > 0 then do something`

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  * To execute code only if data falls within a desired parameter.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```ruby
if condition == value
  p "Something"
end
```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  * `elsif` and `else`

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
```ruby
if condition == value_1
  p "Something"
elsif condition == value_2
  p "Something else"
else
  p "Nothing"
end
```

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  * I'm having a hard time answering this, I keep coming back to an idea that would fall under the 'if` and `elseif` concept.  As a method of comparing data and exectuting code only when that data is the same or different?
